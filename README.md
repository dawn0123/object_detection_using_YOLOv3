# TensorFlow-2.x-YOLOv3 tutorial

YOLOv3 implementation in TensorFlow 2.x, with support for training, transfer training.

## Installation
First, clode or download this GitHub repository.
Install requirements and download pretrained weights:
```
pip install -r ./requirements.txt

# yolov3
wget -P model_data https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights

# yolov3-tiny
wget -P model_data https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3-tiny.weights
```

## Quick start
Start with using pretrained weights to test predictions on both image and video:
```
python detection_demo.py
```

</p>

## Quick training for custom mnist dataset
mnist folder contains mnist images, create training data:
```
python mnist/make_data.py
```
`./yolov3/configs.py` file is already configured for mnist training.

Now, you can train it and then evaluate your model
```
python train.py
tensorboard --logdir=log
```
Track training progress in Tensorboard and go to http://localhost:6006/:

    <img width="100%" src="IMAGES/tensorboard.png" style="max-width:100%;"></a>
</p>

Test detection with `detect_mnist.py` script:
```
python detect_mnist.py
```
Results:

</p>

## Custom Yolo v3 object detection training
Custom training required to prepare dataset first, how to prepare dataset and train custom model you can read in following link:<br>

## Google Colab Custom Yolo v3 training
To learn more about Google Colab Free gpu training, visit my [text version tutorial](https://pylessons.com/YOLOv3-TF2-GoogleColab/)

## Yolo v3 Tiny train and detection
To get detailed instructions how to use Yolov3-Tiny, follow my text version tutorial [YOLOv3-Tiny support](https://pylessons.com/YOLOv3-TF2-Tiny/). Short instructions:
- Get YOLOv3-Tiny weights: ```wget -P model_data https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3-tiny.weights```
- From `yolov3/configs.py` change `TRAIN_YOLO_TINY` from `False` to `True`
- Run `detection_demo.py` script.
